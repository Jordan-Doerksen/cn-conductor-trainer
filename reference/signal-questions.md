# Signal aspects — questions for a working conductor

**Purpose:** unblock the "Read the aspect" section of `modules/Signal Reading.html`. The
CROR *indications* (Rules 405–440, the words) are verified and solid. What's missing is
what each signal physically **looks like** — the lamps — so they can be drawn and signed off.

**Why this exists:** the only aspect source on hand is a third-party study chart
(`reference/CROR Signal Rules.pdf`, a Joseph Hoevet aid — "not an official reference") and
it has at least one confirmed error (it shows an **"A" / absolute plate, which does not
exist in Canada** — that's US practice; the CROR only names DV and R plates, Rules 403/573).
So aspects must be confirmed by an authoritative source or a working conductor before they
go in. Right now only 3 of 42 are encoded and the section is flagged `ASPECTS_DRAFT`.

**Who answers:** any current conductor. **CTC territory is ideal** — that's where the full
speed-signaling set (Limited / Medium / Diverging / Advance, plates, flashing) actually
appears. The questions don't change based on who answers.

## ⭐ The one ask (best case)

> Do you have CN's **official signal aspect chart** — the signal page in the GOI / special
> instructions / timetable? A clear **photo of that page** lets all 42 aspects be encoded
> correctly in one shot, from the authoritative source. If not, no problem — answer the
> questions below from what you actually see out there.

A photo of the real CN chart removes the correctness risk entirely. Everything below is the
fallback if the chart isn't handy.

Confirmed answers logged here as they arrive, so they don't get lost in the thread.

- **Framing correction (conductor, CTC territory):** the straight-route aspects are **not**
  "speed past the signal." They tell you **how many blocks ahead are clear before an
  occupancy** — how much warning you get. Speed only governs the turnout/diverging family.
- **Clear (405):** a **single** green (high mast or low). *(Jordan, firsthand — corrected himself:
  "all green" is **not** Clear; two greens is Clear to Medium.)* — **ENCODED**
- **Clear to Medium (407):** **green over green** (two greens). *(Jordan, firsthand)* — **ENCODED**
- **Clear to Stop (411):** **yellow over red.** Block you're entering clear, the next occupied;
  prepare to stop at the next signal. *(Jordan, firsthand)* — **ENCODED**
- **Advance Clear to Stop (415):** **flashing yellow over red.** Your block + next clear, the
  third occupied; prepare to stop at the second signal. *(Jordan, firsthand)* — **ENCODED**
  (renderer now flashes a single head via a `'f'` suffix, e.g. `"Yf"` = flashing yellow over steady red).
- **Grammar:** **single** green = Clear · **green over green** = Clear to Medium · green on top
  + a non-green lower head = a "Clear to [speed]". *(Jordan, firsthand)*

**Confirmed plate/flash logic (SME):**
- **Plates: only R and DV are used — NO "A" plate.** Conductor-confirmed, on top of the rulebook
  and the Robitaille deck (three independent sources).
- **DV plate is an upgrade:** a Diverging indication **always** carries a DV plate; **strip the DV
  plate and the same aspect downgrades to Slow.** (Matches Robitaille: "DV marker upgrades the indication.")
- **R plate splits 436 vs 437:** two staggered reds **no plate = Stop & Proceed (437)** *(encoded)*;
  the **same two staggered reds + R plate = Restricting (436)**.
- **Flashing indications:** Advance Clear to Stop (415, encoded) · the **Limited** family ·
  Diverging to Stop (429) · Slow to Stop (435). 429 flashes **with** a DV plate; 435 flashes
  **without** one — the plate is the only difference between those two.
- **Head count varies:** signals may be **single-aspect (one head) or dual-aspect (two heads)**.
- **440 Direction Indicator:** an *advance* that you're leaving the main track (a flashing **arrow**,
  a separate fixture — the lamp renderer would need an arrow shape; deferred).

**⚠ Conflict to resolve before encoding — Restricting (436):** described three ways across messages —
(1) single steady yellow · (2) two staggered reds + R plate · (3) red over staggered yellow, no plate.
CROR allows multiple aspects per indication, so all may be valid — but **pick the one to draw** for GP/CTC.
Recommend **(2) two staggered reds + R plate** (cleanest contrast with 437). Awaiting confirmation.

**Still need — the actual lamp colours (top→bottom), same format as 411/415:**
- Diverging (430) = ___/___ **+DV** · Diverging to Stop (429) = ___/___ **flashing +DV**
- Slow to Stop (435) = ___/___ **flashing** (= 429's aspect minus the DV plate)
- Limited to Clear (416) = ___/___ (flashing green on top?)
- **Hypothesis to confirm:** is the diverging/slow base **red over yellow**? (would make 430 = R/Y +DV,
  431 Slow to Clear = R/Y no plate, and the "to Stop" versions flash the lower lamp.)

**Encoded so far (19 — verified 109/109 harness + live):** 405 Clear · 406 Clear to Limited ·
407 Clear to Medium · 409 Clear to Slow · 411 Clear to Stop · 413 Advance Clear to Medium ·
415 Advance Clear to Stop · 419A Limited to Diverging · 421 Limited to Stop · 425 Medium to Slow ·
425A Medium to Diverging · 426 Medium to Restricting · 430 Diverging · 431 Slow to Clear ·
432A Diverging to Limited · 434A Diverging to Diverging · 437 Stop & Proceed · 438 Take or Leave Siding · 439 Stop.
**Resolved:** 430 Diverging = red/yellow + DV plate (confirms the earlier hypothesis). **New plate: "L"**
(Limited marker — a yellow *triangle* in the app; renders as a labelled box for now, could be made a
triangle later). 411's card now notes its 3-head (Y/R/R) form.
**SME sign-off (2026-06-16): Jordan confirmed the first 12 on the live site.** Policy: **one card per
indication, variants noted in the card** (Jordan's call) — e.g. 439's tip notes the 3-red 3-head form.
Useful pattern confirmed across shots: **flashing green = Limited, steady green = Medium/Clear**;
flashing yellow (bottom) = the "to Diverging/Slow" warning. (`ASPECTS_DRAFT` still true until the board is complete.)

**Source decision — the quiz app is trusted.** Jordan **passed his 2025 CROR conductor test using the
CROR Verbal Quiz app**, and the official rulebook (Rule 431) corroborated it. So we encode from the
`signal_screenshots/` shots with confidence; the official rulebook is a bonus cross-check where he can
grab it (it can't be screenshotted easily right now). No more "to-be-verified" asterisks.

**Flash semantics (important when reading the shots):** the quiz app *animates* flashing, so a frozen
screenshot can catch a flashing lamp **mid-off** (appears dark/olive). The **caption / Jordan's markup
is the source of truth for which lamp flashes** — not whether the lamp looks lit in that one frame.
(The official rulebook instead marks flashing with a **static symbol**, no animation — so a rulebook
shot needs no markup.)
`ASPECTS_DRAFT` stays **true** until the full set is in. Renderer handles N heads, dwarf, DV/R plates,
stagger, and per-head flash (`'f'` suffix) — covers everything the screenshots show so far.

**Remaining screenshots to encode (in `signal_screenshots/`):** ~13 more shots already captured
(items ~7–24 of 136); then Jordan continues capturing 25–136. Hold **429 Diverging to Stop** — its
shot used the caption slot for the A-plate trap, so flash state is unconfirmed there.

**Still needed (next):**
- The **exact lower-head colour** for each "Clear to [speed]": Clear to Limited (406) /
  Medium (407) / Slow (409) / Diverging (408) / Restricting (410) — green over *what*?
- The **turnout/diverging family** (Limited / Medium / Diverging / Slow *to* ___) — first word is a real speed.
- **Restricting (436)**, **Diverging (430)**, **Direction Indicator (440)**, **Take/Leave (438)**.
- Confirm **Clear** on a 2-head mast: single green, or green-over-green?

## The question sheet (fallback)

**Paste this framing first:**

> I've got the CROR indications (Rules 405–440) word-for-word — that part's solid. What I
> need is what each signal physically LOOKS like, since you read CTC signals daily. Don't
> worry about rule numbers, just tell me the lamps. Where you're not 100% sure, say so —
> I'd rather have a gap than a wrong lamp.

### A — the system (this generates most of the 42)

> **Corrected by SME:** the straight-route aspects are **not** "speed past the signal." They
> tell you **how many blocks ahead are clear before an occupancy** — how much warning you get.
> Speed only governs the *turnout/diverging* family. So there are really two families:

1. **Hardware on your sub:** colour-light (separate R/Y/G lens per head), searchlight (one
   lens that changes colour), or position-light? Typical mast — **2 heads or 3?**

**A1 · Approach family ("Clear to ___") — block warning, normal speed:**
2. Walk the warning ladder, top→bottom lamps for each:
   - **Clear (405):** all clear ahead → single ___? (green?)
   - **Clear to Stop (411):** your block clear, next occupied → top lamp ___ (steady yellow?)
     over a ___ lower head?
   - **Advance Clear to Stop (415):** your block clear, next clear, third occupied →
     **flashing yellow on top** *(SME-confirmed)* over a ___ lower head?
   - For these — is it a **single head** showing the yellow, or **yellow over red** (2 heads)?
3. Same block-warning idea for **Clear to Limited / Medium / Slow / Diverging / Restricting** —
   what changes in the lamps vs Clear to Stop?

**A2 · Turnout/diverging family ("Limited / Medium / Diverging / Slow to ___") — speed through
the turnouts:**
4. Here the first word *is* a speed. What do these look like (top head colour, lower head,
   flashing) — e.g. **Medium to Clear (422)**, **Limited to Clear (416)**, **Slow to Clear
   (431)**, **Diverging (430)**? When does a **third (bottom) head** appear?
5. Which indications use a **flashing** lamp, and **which lamp** flashes? (Confirmed so far:
   flashing yellow top = Advance Clear to Stop. What else flashes?)

### B — the stand-alones (these break the grammar)
6. **Clear (405)** — single green, one head, right?
7. **Restricting (436)** — aspect? (flashing red / red-over-yellow / lunar white?) Does it
   carry an **R** plate on your sub?
8. **Stop and Proceed (437) vs Stop (439)** — describe exactly what your eyes use to tell an
   *absolute* Stop from a permissive (stop-then-proceed) one. Is it a **number plate
   present/absent**, the **two-red stagger**, or something else? **← the big one, say more here.**
9. **Diverging (430)** — aspect, and does it **always** carry a **DV** plate?
10. **Direction Indicator (440)** — the flashing arrow: separate fixture? colour?
    left / right / straight?
11. **Take or Leave Siding or Other Track (438)** — does GP / your territory even use it?
    If so, what's the aspect?

### C — plates & dwarfs
12. Plates you **actually** see out there: DV, R, anything else? And can you confirm you've
    **never seen an "A" (absolute) plate** — established there's no such plate in Canada,
    want a working conductor to back that.
13. **Dwarf (ground) signals** — which indications show as dwarfs, and do the colours differ
    from the mast version?

**Caveat to include:** some indications have more than one legal aspect — just give the one
you'd actually see on your territory, and note **which sub** that is.

---

## The 3 that must get nailed no matter what
Even a partial answer should cover these — they're what's blocking sign-off today:
1. **437 vs 439** — the physical tell for absolute vs permissive Stop.
2. **Plates** — confirm DV and R, and confirm **no "A" plate**.
3. **Flashing** — which indications flash, and which lamp.

---

## Appendix — how answers map to the encoding (for whoever encodes it)
Each aspect in `modules/Signal Reading.html` (`var ASPECTS`) is:

```js
{ r:"NNN", lvl:"basic|full",
  spec:{ heads:[ ... ],   // lamp colours TOP→BOTTOM: G green · R red · Y yellow · L lunar/white · D dark
         type:"mast|dwarf",
         stagger:true,     // optional — two heads offset L/R (the non-controlled tell)
         flash:true,       // optional — lamp(s) flash
         plaque:"DV|R" },  // optional — plate on the mast (NO "A" in Canada)
  tip:"one-line plain-language note" }
```

So from the answers: Q2/Q3/Q4 → the `heads` array · Q5 → `flash` · Q8 → `stagger` and/or
`plaque` · Q9/Q12 → `plaque` · Q13 → `type:"dwarf"`. Encode against the verified `IND`
table (the words) in the same file, then set `ASPECTS_DRAFT=false` only after a verify pass.
